# SpaceX-Analysis

### Project Name: SpaceX Data Analysis

### Project Objective:

  a.  How can we help SpaceX to improve its business model through the analyzing of data.
  
  b.  By looking at data, specifically through the lens of re-usability of space ship parts.  I hope to find a way for SpaceX to save money by 
      re-using parts of spaceships rather than crash them or leave them in space as many other companies do.

### Job Description:

a.   SpaceX operates in the aerospace industry, specifically in the field of space transportation and exploration. 
  The company designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft with the goal of making space travel more accessible and affordable. 
  SpaceX's services include launching payloads into orbit, resupplying the International Space Station, and transporting astronauts to and from space.
  Additionally, SpaceX is developing new technologies for space exploration, including the Starship spacecraft which is intended for deep space missions to Mars and beyond. 
  The company has also announced plans for a satellite internet service called Starlink, which aims to provide high-speed internet access to underserved areas around the world.

  -  The business analyst position would collect and analyze data related to the company's operations, market trends, and financial performance, and use this data to make recommendations for improvements and optimizations.
  -  Develop and maintain financial models and forecasts to help inform business decisions and strategies.
  -  Work closely with cross-functional teams, including engineering, operations, and finance, to gather requirements and ensure alignment on project objectives.

b.   This project relates to this job posting in the sense that I am working with the engineering team to find ways to reduce ship costs.  And mys olution is to try to design ship parts to be more re-usable.

### Data:

The data for this project was retrived through the followng API: https://api.spacexdata.com/v3
It provides data for many different fields, I specifically used the payloads, ships, launches, and capsules sections.



### Future Improvements

I would have loved to have access to more data directly from SpaceX.  The only API I was able to find was one that was generally cobbeled together from public information.  
To have access to data directly from SpaceX I think would have yielded a lot better insights and would have been a lot more interesting to dive deeper into.
